These files contain the right orbits for the known 3-to-1 APN functions over GF(2^12), in the same order as in Table V of the paper "Deciding and reconstructing linear equivalence of uniformly distributed functions". Each line of a given file corresponds to an element of GF(2^12), the elements being represented as integers between 0 and 2^12-1. The number on the line indexes the orbit to which the element belongs. In particular, there are 2^12 lines in each file, and the number of distinct elements (across all lines) is equal to the number of distinct orbits.
